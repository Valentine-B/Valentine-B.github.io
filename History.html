   <p> Elkhounds are a spitz type dog. The breed is approximately thousands of years old, possibly dating as back to 5000 BCE.</p>
  <p>They were originally bred to hunt big game in northern Europe. </p>
  <p>Their name is inaccurate because they were actually bred to hunt moose not Elk.</p>
  <p>In Norwegian the word for Moose is Elg, which is where the confusion in their name come from. </p>
