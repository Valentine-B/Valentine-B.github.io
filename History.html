<h1>A Brief History of Norwegian Elkhounds</h1>
  <p>Elkhounds are a spitz type dog. The breed is approximately 5000 years old.</p>
  <p>They were originally bred to hunt big game in northern Europe. </p>
  <p>Their name is inaccurate because they were actually bred to hunt moose not Elk.</p>
  <p>In Norwegian the word for Moose is Elg, which is where the confusion in their name come in. </p>
